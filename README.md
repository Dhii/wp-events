# [DEPRECATED] Dhii - WP Events
This package has moved to [`wp-oop/wp-events`][].

## Details
A [PSR-14][] compliant event manager and wrapper for WordPress. It uses the WordPress hook system, while providing
a standards-compliant OOP interface, allowing for complete de-coupling from WordPress hooks.
